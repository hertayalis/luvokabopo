Founder: Zach Brown and Alyssa Brown Asked For $150,000 for 5% at<strong> $3 million</strong> valuation on Shark Tank.</p><p>Moki Doorstep net worth. Moki Doorstep was valued at<strong> $ 3 million</strong> on Shark Tank. Moki Doorstep Competitor There is no competitor identified for Moki Doorstep. Moki Doorstep FAQS? What is Moki Doorstep? Moki Doorstep is a device that allows users to reach the top of their vehicles.</p><p>Moki Doorstep: $3 Million Daymond John Shark Tank Deal Fell Through On Season 10 of Shark Tank, paramedic/firefighter Zach Brown and his ER nurse wife Alyssa Brown of Newington, Connecticut pitched Moki Doorstep, a step that hooks over the u-shaped door latch in a vehicle’s door so you can reach the roof of the vehicle with ease.</p><p>Alas, the deal with Daymond didn’t not come to fruition but Moki Doorsteps are still available for purchase online and at a number of retailers including Dick’s Sporting Goods. And the Browns welcomed their second child (Alyssa was pregnant when they filmed the Shark Tank episode).</p><p>The Moki Door Step is a vehicle attachment that is compatible with any car. It hooks to the door latch of a car and allows someone to easily and safely access the roof of their car to load skis, bikes, kayaks, and more. Both feet can fit on the doorstep, permitting balance and safety for anyone who needs to access the top of their car.</p><p>As soon as Zach demonstrated the product the sharks were amazed by how easy it was to attach the step to the door. Zach further states the step can hold up to 400 pounds of weight. Robert Herjevec asks “who came up with these designs” the product seemed like a simple solution to problems no one had addressed before.</p><h2>Why is Moki Doorstep called Moki Doorstep?</h2><p>Moki Doorstep hopes<strong> to prevent short family members from shirking work when packing cars for trip by creating a product that gives them a literal leg up to help them reach the top.</strong> The name, “Moki Doorstep” was inspired by Indians who used to build steps into walls.</p><p>Created by a husband and diminutive wife from Newtown, CT, Moki Doorstep is<strong> a literal step up that hooks into the strike of a car door providing firm footing for someone to be able to not just reach the top of a car but to potentially reach across.</strong> The doorstep can be placed and removed in seconds and, according to shorter of the two entrepreneurs, creates a firm foundation on which to stand. The step hooks into the “strike” of the car which the entrepreneur claims exists in most vehicles.</p><p>When they expressed that, they would be more likely to sell the company than to take an investor at that value, Daymond jumped on the idea and offered the entrepreneurs the cash amount of the value they proposed at the start of the deal,<strong> $3,000,000</strong> for the whole kit and caboodle. The entrepreneurs accepted and Daymond made one of the few buyouts in the show’s history!</p><p>Up until this deal, Daymond had invested a paltry<strong> $25,000</strong> into one deal, Cup Board Pro, a deal that he had gone into with four other sharks. In fact, in nine episodes, this was only his fourth appearance! Were we losing Daymond John as a shark? Was he no longer interested in the show?</p><h2>What is a Moki door step?</h2><p>The Moki Doorstep is<strong> an aircraft-grade aluminum step made to reach the rooftop of the car.</strong> Zach and Alyssa Brown a married couple from Newington came up with the idea to help people who can’t reach the rooftop of the car. The aluminum step is hooked to the car’s door latch to give the person extra feet to reach the top for sports gear …</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Zach states the name came from the Moki<strong> steps carved foot skills by pueblos of southwest America.</strong> As soon as Zach demonstrated the product the sharks were amazed by how easy it was to attach the step to the door. Zach further states the step can hold up to 400 pounds of weight.</p><p>They launched their product in 2017 with a Kickstarter campaign which helped them raise<strong> $11,000</strong> with the help of 2000 backers. Zach brown himself had invested $300,000 in the business. Another $300,000 was invested by his uncle who was to be paid $1 per gear for 18 years.</p><p>Upon asking about the investors Zach revealed that his uncle has invested<strong> $300,000</strong> and receives $1 per gear sold. Kevin thought the valuation of the company was high. To which Zach explains that he took advice from CFO from a large auto part company who suggested that he shouldn’t value it at any less than $3 million.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoZmkYra0ecyooqJllKS8s7%2FTnqdmr5%2Bnwal5lnBpbG1f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./clark-backo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Clark Backo">&larr;
