"My brother, Simon, got married last week but they postponed their honeymoon because of his job. So when the advert came out yesterday, my sister-in-law Nancy saw it in the shopping center. She called me and asked why I have bridal photos in the city center and I told her I got an offer to model bridal gowns for this boutique."</p><p>Thinking she didn't do anything wrong, she asked Nancy "what she thought" of the photos. She didn't get the response she was hoping for.</p><p>"Honestly, I was expecting feedback like 'you looked beautiful' or 'the gowns looked good on you', but <a href=#>instead she yelled at me on the phone</a> and accused me of being jealous of her," she continued. "I was surprised because Nancy and I are friendly with each other, I didn’t expect her to blow up on me like that. She hung up on me and a few minutes later I got a call from her sister, who sounded really upset with me for stealing her sister’s thunder."</p><p>The woman stood up for herself.</p><p>"I told her Nancy’s wedding was literally 7 days ago, so why are they accusing me of stealing her thunder? We got into a verbal altercation, she called me names, and I retaliated and called her names before I hung up," she said, adding her sister-in-law's family has been leaving negative comments on her modeling photos after she posted them on social media.</p><p>"Last night I saw a <a href=#>TikTok</a> video about the whole situation and a lot of Nancy’s friends are siding with her, they said I was jealous of the bride that’s why I did the photo shoot. They’re also commenting nasty things on my Instagram, so I had to turn the comment section off," she wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, her brother refuses to address it: "I asked Simon to talk to his wife but he wants nothing to do with it."</p><p>In the comments, users mostly sided with the woman, claiming she was simply "doing her job" and that her sister-in-law is overreacting.</p><p>"I don't understand what's wrong with those people. She had her day, you are doing your job. This sounds like people in their teens," one person wrote.</p><p>"You were working and even if you weren't, how long is anything bridal banned for because of her wedding? She, her sister and her friends are ridiculous," another user commented.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Celebrity Family Feuds</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kxLC5wKdkpqeUmrmqusZmrp6clJ67qHnDq5ysq5WoerS10q2cq2WZo3qtrdZmrp6clJ67qHnRnpudoaRk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ncis-new-orleans-cbs-season-6-epsiode-6-chris-lasalle-death-cade-murderer-eddie-barrett-lucas-black.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'NCIS: New Orleans' Season 6 Episode 6 sees Lasalle's alleged murderer arrested but questions about ">&larr;
