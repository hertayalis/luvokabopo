Her baking show started after she filmed the process of making themed treats at a party, which promptly received momentum. Her early baking videos gained a steady following, and viewers eventually started to request more. Because she had never seen a baking show on television or the Internet, Pansino decided to create the Nerdy Nummies series.

She remained adamant that she would not quit YouTube, despite the risks being taken at the time. Pansino told Cosmopolitan in 2015: " At this point, I wasn't making any money on YouTube. I knew that it was possible to do that but I wasn't making a dime. I decided, I'm going to do this. I'm not going to let YouTube go. My agent's going to drop me. And he did. That's when I totally invested 100 percent of my time and my life savings into my channel. I worked on my channel full-time for a year before I started to make money. I just had to live off my savings. I lived in a really small apartment with, like, six people and three bedrooms."</p><p>In 2019, she made an appearance as a guest judge on Netflix original competitive-baking show Nailed It!.</p><p>In 2019, Pansino was admitted to a local hospital after complaining of suffering severe pain and illness.
