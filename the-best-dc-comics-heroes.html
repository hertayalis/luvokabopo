Thanks to his alien DNA and how it reacts to Earth’s yellow sun, he’s equipped with super strength, speed, endurance, and many other spectacular abilities. He’s faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than — you know the rest.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>Superman’s legendary weakness is green kryptonite, the glowing material, and fragments from his homeworld. Magical attacks also have a way of bypassing his incredible endurance.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>While the Man of Steel primarily operates in the city of Metropolis, he has battled all manner of villains, from evil scientists (Lex Luthor) to galactic tyrants (Darkseid).

That’s easy: the one and only Plastic Man!</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Patrick O’Brian sports an iconic look and costume and really knows how to — don’t hate me for this — stretch his limited powerset to full effect. The world’s goofiest hero can use his abilities to morph his body into some of the most outrageous objects. Turning into a ball to ram into a criminal’s chest is one of the plainer tricks in Plastic Man’s toolbox.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>A frequent teammate of some of DC’s more prominent characters, Plastic Man serves as a nice contrast to his more serious and stern allies.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Doctor Fate</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/doctor-fate-dc-first.png><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Before Marvel had Doctor Strange, before the publication even wore that name, the world only knew one mystical doctor: the mysterious and swank-helmet-wearing Doctor Fate!</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>Fans were introduced to Doctor Fate in 1940, and many characters have since donned the title and magical mantle. However, fans are arguably more aware of Kent Nelson, the first Doctor Fate.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>While not always the sanest of heroes, especially due to the character’s affiliation with Nabu and the Lords of Order, Doctor Fate is a colossal force and absolute goliath when it comes to magical ability.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Etrigan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-design-50.png><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Another magical entry on this list is Etrigan the Demon. Created by comic legend Jack Kirby, Etrigan first debuted in the early ’70s.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>Thankfully, despite being a demon, the fire-breathing Etrigan is primarily a force for good. Bonded with the human Jason Blood, fans have seen the character team up with DC’s greatest champions, especially when they are up against mystical threats.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Nightwing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Nightwing-Cover.jpg><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>When you grow up with Batman as an adoptive father, you’re bound to learn a few tricks or two. Dick Grayson may have started out as a boy wonder, but he would cement his status as a standalone champion when he became Nightwing.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>Under this mantle, Grayson has been a protector of Gotham and Blüdhaven, continued his heroic work as a Teen Titan, and, of course, partnered up with his former mentor countless times. A master acrobat and martial artist wielding his own set of spectacular gadgets, Nightwing is one of DC’s most popular heroes.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Doctor Manhattan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/doctor-manhattan-1.jpg><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>While not one of the DC Universe’s traditional figureheads, Doctor Manhattan is still an iconic presence whether it’s in a comic panel or on the silver screen.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>While not one of the DC Universe’s traditional figureheads, Doctor Manhattan is still an iconic presence, whether it’s in a comic panel or on the silver screen.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Born Jonathan Osterman, the scientist-turned-godlike superhero is one of the main characters of Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore’s legendary Watchmen series. With such an amazing character arc in arguably the greatest comic series ever created and an unstoppable power set, it’s nigh impossible not to include Doctor Manhattan in a list dedicated to the greatest DC heroes.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Captain Atom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Untitled-design-51-1.png><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>Captain Atom is an energy-manipulating powerhouse. Often portrayed as an American patriot and a strict do-gooder who always does things by the book, he is one of DC’s most stalwart heroes.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>While not exactly on the same level as Superman, Captain Atom has proven he can at least contend with the Man of Steel on multiple occasions. A consistent member of the Justice League, Captain Atom can often be seen teaming up with DC’s greatest champions.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Adam Strange</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-design-52.png><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>One of DC’s most storied characters is the space-faring Adam Strange. A regular human explorer who gets sucked into intergalactic adventures and battles, Strange offers comic fans a chance to experience some of DC’s greatest tales through a more grounded lens. How would you react teleported to the planet Rann via a Zeta-Beam and had to team up with an alien princess against various otherworldly threats?</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>Even if you’re not the most hardcore comic fan, Adam Strange’s adventures should appeal to the sci-fi lover in us all. Having debuted in the late ’50s, his stories can surely offer a little something for every fan.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Stargirl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Stargirl.png><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>Wielding a powerful cosmic staff and wearing a Star-Spangled outfit, Courtney Whitmore serves as one of DC’s most wholesome heroes.</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>Often seen partnering up with her stepfather, who fights crime in a robotic suit of armor, Whitmore dons the mantle of Stargirl after finding the weapon previously used by the hero Starman.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=false>DC fans have probably witnessed many of Whitmore’s adventures in various animated and live-action productions. Often portrayed as a young heroine, Stargirl has teamed up with countless other heroes her age. Boasting a fun personality and exuberant fighting spirit, Stargirl’s adventures tend to offer fans and readers a lively and heartfelt experience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX6m1pnnBnqqtZZSYeqS7zKKarGWYmr%2BwsdJo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./capcom-shares-scrapped-enemies-resident-evil-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Capcom Shares Scrapped Enemy Designs From Resident Evil 2">&larr;
