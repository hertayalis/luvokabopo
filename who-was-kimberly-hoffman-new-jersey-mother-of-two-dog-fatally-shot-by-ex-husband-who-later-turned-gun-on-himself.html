The shocking incident occurred shortly after Kimberly Hoffman called 911 to report a break-in at her house.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer, the 49-year-old dialed 911 on Saturday, July 29 at about 5.00 am to report to officials that someone was attempting to break into her apartment located in Little Egg Harbor, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Post</a>.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Where is Theresa Nist now? New Jersey native excited to tie the knot with 'The Golden Bachelor' Gerry Turner live on TV</a></p><h2 class=split>Who was Kimberly Hoffman?</h2><p>Hoffman, the mother of two was the director of admissions at Seacrest Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center which is a nursing home in Little Egg Harbor. She was found dead with apparent gunshot injuries on her face. In a statement issued following the incident, Billhimer said, "Responding Officers made forced entry into the apartment, where they located the deceased body of Ms. Hoffman with an apparent gunshot wound to the face." The dispatchers then discovered the deceased body of Hoffman's dog and also of her ex-husband, Carl Schulz.</p><p>The 52-year-old man was still conscious when the officers found him. He was then shifted to Atlantic City's AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City where he was later pronounced dead. "The investigation revealed that Schulz shot Ms. Hoffman, and the dog, before turning the gun on himself," said Billhimer.&nbsp;However, it remains unclear whether the gunman was the father of the victim's two sons.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Om Brahmbhatt: NJ man faces first degree murder charges after gunning down 3 family members in random act of violence</a></p><h2 class=split>GoFundMe set up to raise money for Hoffman's sons</h2><p>A GoFundMe page was set up to raise money for Hoffmans' two sons whose ages have not been revealed. As of Tuesday morning, August 1, the page raised over $52,000. "As we grieve this devastating loss, we want to rally around Kim’s children, who meant the world to her. We have set up this GoFundMe page to provide support and stability for her children during this unimaginable time," said the account.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Slain New Jersey high school football star Rocco Rodden's father remembers him as 'biggest warrior and protector'</a></p><p>"Kim was a remarkable person who touched the lives of many with her kindness, compassion, and infectious smile. “She had a heart of gold and was always there to lend a helping hand to those in need. As a dedicated mother, she poured her love into her two children, making sure they felt safe, loved, and cherished every day," read the GoFundMe page.</p><p>"Kim’s life was tragically cut short, leaving behind her children who now face a future without their beloved mother. The pain of her loss is immeasurable, and we are all devastated by this senseless act of violence. Our hearts ache for her children, and we want to do everything we can to ease their burden during this difficult time," wrote the organizer Natalie Adis. The motive behind the murder-suicide is still being investigated by the Little Egg Harbor Police Department and detectives from the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office Major Crime Unit.</p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).</span><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Internet dubs Olivia Dunne ‘cringe’ as she opens about her New Jersey accent in TikTok video</a></p><p><a href=#>Alix Earle introduces Braxton Berrios to family on Thanksgiving, Internet calls it 'iconic'</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikerit0maioqWSmr%2BtxYyhpp%2BenZa7brrEsGSjnaKosrp5zKiroZ2iYrynedOwpmacn5x6p63TmqOlsV2otbDAjJuwZp2oYrW2v8GapZ1lp528brjArZyrZaSqv6%2Bxw2aerqZdpLtutMimqp6klg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zach-ertz-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zach Ertz Net Worth - NewsNow Nigeria">&larr;
