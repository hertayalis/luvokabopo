Marriage is fine,"</strong> adding: "I don't know what y'all are doin', but find something else to do cause we fine, Lord have mercy."</p><p id=e0EwGkLCwvr data-wc=55>Marjorie followed suit with her own post on Instagram where she wrote: "My husband and I don't usually stop to address all the foolishness and lies that have been spread about us," noting: "I understand that with my platform comes some sort of responsibility to those that may not be as strong as we are."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Steve Harvey unveils new look without famous mustache</figure><p id=eJs4VI_STR4 data-wc=24>Clearly, Steve and Marjorie have maintained a loving, steady relationship since tying the knot in 2007, and you can read all about it below.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Who is Steve Harvey's wife?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=e5hbgHfl44q data-wc=37>Marjorie Harvey (née Bridges), 59, is Steve's third wife. She hails from Tennessee, and before becoming a designer, business owner, blogger (for The Lady Loves Couture) and social media personality, she briefly attended The University of Memphis.</p><p id=emUNzpphV4B data-wc=51>She has three children from her previous marriage to <strong>Darnell Woods</strong>: Morgan, 36, Jason, 32, and Lori,26, all of whom use Harvey as their last name. Today, Marjorie runs the Steve and Marjorie Harvey Foundation, which the couple founded shortly after tying the knot, and focuses on providing youth outreach services.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How did Steve Harvey meet his wife Marjorie?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1fea3ef80d89-gettyimages-93014547.jpg><p id=eu-yCgtB0Ul data-wc=19>Steve and Marjorie were clearly destined to be together, but it took them some time to make it happen.</p><p id=ednjzYj-hYw data-wc=67>The two first met in 1990 at Memphis comedy club The Comedy Zone, where Steve was performing. Marjorie immediately caught her future husband's eye, and during an appearance on his eponymous show in 2018, she recalled: <strong>"He was just staring at me… He finally realized, 'Oh, I gotta say something.' He was, like, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know who this is, but I'm gonna marry her.'"</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c9756142255d-steve-harvey-kids-famous-family.jpg><p id=e_tw9wUpHGf data-wc=30>They briefly dated but it fizzled out. In 2014, Marjorie told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Essence</a>: "I knew he was The One shortly after I started [dating] him… but then he just left. Disappeared."</p><p id=eWostj8GbgME data-wc=35>Steve, who was previously married to his first wife <strong>Marcia Harvey</strong> from 1981 until their separation in 1990 (they divorced in 1994), eventually married <strong>Mary Lee Shackelford</strong> in 1996, though they too divorced in 2005.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>When did Steve Harvey marry Marjorie Harvey?</strong></h2><p id=ehN4vhmH5cMA data-wc=57>After Steve split from his second wife, it was his bodyguard who insisted he reconnect with Marjorie. In 2016, he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>: "He told me, 'Look, the only time I've ever seen you happy was when you were with that woman Marjorie. Now, before you go and do something stupid and marry another woman, I'm calling her.'"</p><p id=e85lMCFtEaln data-wc=39>It was undoubtedly the right decision, and he also told the outlet: "Marjorie changed the way I existed." He recalled: <strong>"It was like being reborn. I messed up so many times in my life. She made all the difference."</strong></p><p id=es8QeO7SvmAH data-wc=26>The two tied the knot on June 25, 2007, and earlier this summer, they celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary with a trip to Lake Como, Italy.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Who are Steve Harvey's kids?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/012d10203bee-gettyimages-168676883.jpg><p id=ec5G8tWz_3h7 data-wc=39>Steve and Marjorie have a blended family of seven. Aside from being a stepdad to his wife's three kids, he also shares twin daughters Brandi and Karli, 41, and Broderick, 31, with Marcia, plus Wynton, 26, with Mary Lee.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Does Steve Harvey have grandchildren?</strong></h2><p id=ep66Vq6MI65Y data-wc=47>Not only do Steve and Marjorie have seven children, they have seven grandchildren too! Marjorie's son Jason shares four kids with his wife Amanda, and his sister Morgan shares two daughters with her husband Kareem. Steve's eldest daughter Karli also has a son, with her husband Ben.</p><p id=esUZYsRWnkQ data-wc=31><strong>Get the lowdown on the biggest, hottest celebrity news, features and profiles coming out of the U.S. <a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our HELLO!
