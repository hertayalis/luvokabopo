He is the pastor of the Perfecting Faith Church in Freeport, New York, a gospel singer, musician, songwriter, choir director, author, actor, and a radio host, who has won multiple prestigious awards.</p><p>So just how rich is Donnie McClurkin? According to sources, McClurkin has managed to accumulate a net worth of $5 million, as of early 2016. The main source of his wealth has been his successful music career, his television and movie appearances, radio hosting as well as his guest appearances in various television shows.</p><h3>Donnie McClurkin Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>McClurkin was raised one of the ten children, but his childhood was not pretty, as following the tragedy of losing his younger brother who died when hit by a car, McClurkin became a victim of sexual abuse, firstly by his great uncle when he was eight, and then again by his great uncle’s son when McClurkin was 13 years old. He also witnessed physical violence between his parents, while his sisters began using drugs. Things weren’t better in school either: McClurkin was shy and athletically incompetent, born with a physical deformity of web hands and feet, which led to his peers often laughing at him. He found an escape from his harsh childhood reality by going to church, where he became active in gospel choirs. His aunt introduced him to the gospel singer Andrae Crouch, whose music started to build a new passion in him. She eventually became his mentor, and McClurkin soon formed his own gospel group The New York Restoration Choir. However, as he had managed to find an escape from his old struggles, the new ones began. Being molested by men, his quest for sexual identity became a world of confusion, and McClurkin began fighting a hard battle within himself, a battle against homosexuality.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donnie found a break with singing a solo at a music shop hosted by the Winans family – well-known gospel singers – with whom he later appeared on Broadway performing in the gospel show “Don’t Get God Started”. In 1989 he followed the <a href=#>Winans</a> family to Detroit, becoming the associate minister of Reverend <a href=#>Marvin Winans</a> who eventually made him a part of Perfecting Faith Church in New York, and where McClurkin is now Senior Pastor. He started to lead various Bible studies and preaching in New York, willing to reach out to other people who were sexually abused as children and give them hope through his gospel. Homosexuality was no longer his inclination.</p><p>In 1991 McLurkin was diagnosed with acute leukemia, but instead of accepting modern medical treatments, he decided to turn to the power of prayer to cure himself. Miraculously, he quickly recovered and no evidence of cancer was found in his further tests.</p><p>McClurkin’s gospel singing soon took a professional level acquiring him significant net worth. He released his first solo album in 1996, a self-titled debut containing original songs, such as the popular “Stand” as well as gospel classics like “Holy, Holy, Holy”: the disc went gold. He released his second album “Live in London and More…” in 2000, which went platinum. His next gold album “Again” was released in 2003, another platinum “Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs” in 2004, followed by his live album “We All Are One (Live in Detroit)” in 2008. His singing career had made him a gospel star and established considerable wealth.</p><p>McClurkin also signed a radio syndication deal with advertising giant Dial-Global and syndicator Gary Bernstein. In the meantime, McClurkin went on with his ministry work, being ordained in 2001 and opening up his own Perfecting Faith Church on Long Island. The same year he published the inspirational memoir “Eternal Victim, Eternal Victor” detailing his recovery from sexual abuse and the struggle to identify his sexuality in accordance with his Christian principles.</p><p>In 2004 McClurkin released a movie about his life “From Darkness to Light: The Donnie McClurkin Story”. He also starred in the 2003 movie “The Fighting Temptations” and the 2005 “Gospel”, while also appearing in television shows such as “Girlfriends” and “The Parkers”. In 2009 he released his own television series “Perfecting Your Faith”. McClurkin had become one of the richest pastors worldwide.</p><p>His successful career has brought him three Grammy Awards, ten Stellar awards, two BET awards, Two Soul Train awards, Dove and NAACP Image award.</p><p>In 2001 McClurkin’s son was born. Although not being married to his son’s mother Kim, McClurkin worked hard to be in his son’s life. The following year, he adopted a 9-year-old named Michelle as his daughter.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=23.281278538813><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Donnie McClurkin</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 9, 1959</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Amityville, New York, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 1" (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, gospel singer, pastor, actor, author, songwriter</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Matthew McClurkin</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Parents</td><td>Frances McClurkin, Donald Andy McClurkin Sr., Days Of Elijah, I Call You Faithful, Great Is Your Mercy</td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/DonnieMcClurkin</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/donnieradio</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/donniemcclurkin</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0566056</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Awards, ten Stellar awards, two BET awards, Two Soul Train awards, Dove and NAACP Image award</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Albums</td><td>Live in London and More…, Again (2003), Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs (2004), We All Are One (Live in Detroit) (2008)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Music Groups</td><td>The New York Restoration Choir</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nominations</td><td>NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Gospel Album, American Music Award for Favorite Contemporary Inspirational Artist, Soul Train Music Award for Best Gospel/Inspirational Song, Days Of Elijah, I Call You Faithful, Great Is Your Mercy</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Movies</td><td>Perfecting Your Faith (2009)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Don’t Get God Started</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Super Bowl Gospel Celebration</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Donnie McClurkin</td></tr><tr><td>Let's Stay Together</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Reverend Watson</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Living It Up with Patti LaBelle</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Gospel</td><td>2005</td><td></td><td>Minister Hunter</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Diary of a Mad Black Woman</td><td>2005</td><td></td><td>Pastor (uncredited)</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=5.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>22nd Annual Trumpet Awards</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Special performer: "Stand" / writer: "Stand"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Gospel</td><td>2005</td><td>performer: "Ooh Child Urban Mix"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>The Ladykillers</td><td>2004</td><td>performer: "Come, Let Us Go Back to God"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>An Extremely Goofy Movie</td><td>2000</td><td>Video performer: "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=26><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The Real</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Covered-Alive in Asia</td><td>2016</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Sunday Best</td><td>2011-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself -
