In it, Anderson said was a quote from a psychologist that read: "When a person is unable to complete a mourning task in childhood, he either has to surrender his emotions in order that they do not suddenly overwhelm him, or else he may be haunted constantly throughout his life, with a sadness for which he can never find an appropriate explanation."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/092928fe8cac-anderson-cooper-family.jpg><p id=eDNSWm8ecDW- data-wc=55>"That's me," he then confessed, adding: "That's exactly what I did. When my dad died in 1978, I dug a deep hole inside myself and pushed my fear and sadness and anger down into it. I barely even cried. A decade later, when my brother Carter died by suicide, I pushed those feelings down further."</p><p id=eGAAoe8xUNHU data-wc=33>He continued: "I thought I could keep all that grief buried forever, but it turns out grief doesn't work that way.
