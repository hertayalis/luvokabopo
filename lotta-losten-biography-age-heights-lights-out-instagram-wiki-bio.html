And after that, Lotta started acting at Blekinge Ians folkhogskola for two years.</p><h2>Age and Measurements</h2><p>Talking about her age, Lotta is 37 years as of 2019.

Lotta first made her debut in the 2013 short film&nbsp;Cam Closer. Then in 2013, the actress with her husband, <strong>David F. Sandberg</strong>, created Light Out.&nbsp;The film was something the couple created out of fun and with a fair amount of money as well.</p><p>Lotta, who played the protagonist in the movie, is chased or haunted by a creature that can move without light but cannot do so in the presence of light. Surprisingly, the film was chosen as the finalist for the Bloody Cuts Horror Challenge, and her husband, David, even won the Best Director award.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cash Baker Biography- Age, Height, Siblings, Girlfriend, Merch, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>The movie, something they made out of pure fun, became such a hit online that it garnered millions of views attracting Hollywood director’s and producers’ attention.

As mentioned above, David is a Swedish filmmaker.

Just like any other project, the couple had a fair share of this production as well. The movie turned out to be successful both critically and commercially as the film accumulated<strong> $148.9 million</strong> worldwide.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income</h2><p>Apart from her acting career, Losten is also an active designer and photographer.
