Costa frequently hosts top mainstream news reporters on the program. "I've always worked to be highly disciplined in my reporting. ... to be sensitive to constant objectivity," Costa told the Associated Press in 2017.</p><p>In March 2016, Costa interviewed Trump with <a href=#>Bob Woodward</a>, who has been a mentor to him. Costa served as guest host of PBS' <a href=#>Charlie Rose</a> in March 2017.</p><p>On December 10, 2015, Costa was named a political analyst for both NBC and MSNBC. Costa is known for his deep sourcing within national political circles. He has interviewed President Donald Trump on multiple occasions. Politico has called him the "Trump whisperer."</p><p>Costa was on the board of trustees at Notre Dame from 2014–17 and currently serves on the advisory council for the Donald R. Keough School of Global Affairs.</p><p>At Cambridge, Costa was an active member of The Cambridge Union debating society and focused his research on Winston Churchill and United Kingdom–United States relations. His adviser was Andrew Gamble, a British academic and author.</p><p>In 2013, during the United States federal government shutdown, Costa's reporting on the Republican party in Congress was widely praised. The New Republic called him "the most important reporter in the country over the past few weeks" and Slate writer <a href=#>David Weigel</a> called him "omnipresent." New York magazine called him "the golden boy of the government shutdown."</p><p>In November 2013, he left National Review and was hired by The Washington Post, joining the paper officially in January 2014. Newsbusters, a media watchdog website for the conservative organization Media Research Center, said that it was "perhaps the first time in decades that a top-tier 'mainstream' news outlet has hired away a reporter from a right-leaning publication."</p><p>Costa was a Robert L. Bartley Fellow at The Wall Street Journal. In 2010, he was hired as a reporter by the conservative magazine National Review. In December 2012, he was promoted to the position of Washington editor for National Review.

On campus, he hosted and produced an interview program for ND-TV called Office Hours.</p><p>He grew up in Lower Makefield Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where he attended Pennsbury High School and graduated in 2004. While at Pennsbury, Sports Illustrated writer <a href=#>Michael Bamberger</a> profiled Costa in his non-fiction book, Wonderland: A Year in the Life of an American High School. He was also friends with actor <a href=#>Zach Woods</a> and journalist <a href=#>Hallie Jackson</a>, two fellow Pennsbury students.</p><p><a href=#>Robert Costa</a> (born October 14, 1985) is an American journalist.
